Great! Let's dive into how the **Adapter Design Pattern** is used in your system and how it works step by step:

---

### âœ… What is the Adapter Pattern?

The Adapter Pattern **wraps a legacy or incompatible interface** so it can be used as if it implements a modern interface.

---

### ðŸ§© Where it's used in your code?

You've got a **legacy class** called `LegacyBankApi`:

```java
public class LegacyBankApi {
    public void initiate(String refId, double value) {
        System.out.println("Initiating legacy bank transaction...");
    }
}
```

But your modern system expects all payment processors to implement this:

```java
public interface PaymentProcessor {
    void process(String orderId, double amount);
}
```

These donâ€™t match directly â€” **`initiate()` â‰  `process()`**.

---

### ðŸ›  How the Adapter Solves This

You created a **`LegacyBankApiAdapter`**, which implements `PaymentProcessor` and wraps the legacy method:

```java
public class LegacyBankApiAdapter implements PaymentProcessor {
    private final LegacyBankApi legacyApi = new LegacyBankApi();

    @Override
    public void process(String orderId, double amount) {
        legacyApi.initiate(orderId, amount);
    }
}
```

Now your system can use the legacy API **as if itâ€™s a regular `PaymentProcessor`**, without changing the legacy class.

---

### ðŸ§ª How to Simulate It in Runtime

Letâ€™s say a customer pays via an external banking gateway. You can trigger this dynamically:

#### Step 1: Modify `OrderCreatedEvent` to include a payment method
```java
private String paymentMethod; // e.g., "EXTERNAL"
```

#### Step 2: Update `OrderService` to send this method
```java
OrderCreatedEvent event = new OrderCreatedEvent(orderId, request.getCustomerId(), request.getAmount(), request.getPaymentMethod());
```

#### Step 3: In `PaymentConsumer`:
```java
var processor = PaymentProcessorFactory.getProcessor(event.getPaymentMethod());
```

Now if `"EXTERNAL"` is passed, it uses `ExternalPaymentAdapter`, which wraps `LegacyBankApi`.

---

### ðŸ“¦ Summary

- âœ… **LegacyBankApi** is unchanged (closed for modification).
- âœ… You now use it like a modern `PaymentProcessor`.
- âœ… Makes your system **open for extension** â€” you can plug in other legacy APIs the same way.

Would you like me to show how to refactor `OrderCreatedEvent` and wiring this in a real request example?
